## Optimization Techniques Implemented

* Reduced image and video sizes to 300-400 KB for faster loading.
* Lazy-loaded images using Next.js `Image` component.
* Applied `max-w-full` and `overflow-x-hidden` to prevent horizontal scrolling.
* Minimized CSS and used Tailwind utility classes for performance.
* Animated elements optimized with Framer Motion and `whileInView` for better LCP.

## Lighthouse Performance Scores (Local Testing)

* **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** \~2.8s (improved after image/video optimization)
* **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** 0
* **Interaction to Next Paint (INP):** 216 ms

I can also make a **shorter version suitable for GitHub display**, including a section for a **Lighthouse screenshot** if you want.  

Do you want me to make that too?
